# Dual_Wlan_Chat
to launch from the source code you need to setup SFML first

but you can always try it by launching the executable file in "bin/Debug"

start an instance of the application in a device and another one in another device

keep the two of them connected to the same wifi

choose "s" for the server in one of the two devices and "c" for the client in the other one

copy the ip address from the server to the client

start chatting :)

if you wanna end it just write "exit" (you can now discover that it's impossible to send such message to your friend XD )
